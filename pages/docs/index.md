# RAGO - RAG OpenAPI Framework

## Introduction

`RAGO` is the first REST API fuzzing tool modeled in [JastAdd](https://jastadd.cs.lth.se/).


First of all, This tool parses [an OpenAPI specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/) in Java classes and transfers it into `AST-Node`. These Nodes are able to be re-transformed and saved in JSON which describes its API Specification, if needed.

After the parsing phase, `RAGO` is prepared to generate tests automatically in two different ways based on Fuzzing, [Random Testing](#ragoRandTest) and [Parameter Inference](#ragoParamInf).

## OpenAPI Specification in JastAdd

[OpenAPI specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers and is represented in JSON or YAML. It consists of 30 objects and is structured in a tree-shape.


To understand better how OpenAPI documentations could be transformed in JastAdd, compare the following Object in the JastAdd-grammar and [OpenAPI Object description](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#oasObject)
```
OpenAPIObject ::=   <OpenAPI> <JsonSchemaDialect> I:InfoObject Serv:ServerObject*
                    P:PathsObject* W:Webhook* C:ComponentsObject Sr:SecurityRequirementObject*
                    T:TagObject* [E:ExternalDocObject] Ex:Extension*;
```

There are some implementation details developers must consider:

- JastAdd doesn't support `Map`. So, it must be constructed in a tuple (AST-Node). e.g.
    - `ServerVariablesTuple ::= <Name> S:ServerVariableObject;` 
    - `variables` in [Server Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#serverObject)

- In OAS, several objects can be replaced by [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#referenceObject). In `RAGO`, we implemented this structure in an abstract node to every concerned object. e.g. 
    - [Parameter Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#parameterObject)
    - following abstract node in JastAdd
  

Example of [Parameter Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#parameterObject) implementation
``` 
  abstract ParameterOb;
  ParameterReference : ParameterOb ::= <Ref> ...;
  ParameterObject : ParameterOb ::= <Name> <In> ...;
```


- Most objects can be extended with `Extension` containing unfixed name and values. In JastAdd, this is also implemented in a tuple (AST-Node) `Extension ::= <Key> <Value:Object>;`

## Fuzzing in RAGO

To generate API tests automatically, `RAGO` supports two following techniques based on Fuzzing which involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to an API.

In this first version, this tool considers only two request types, `GET` and `POST`, and parameters. It means that `RAGO` currently generates only URLs.

### <a name="ragoRandTest"></a>Random Testing

Random testing is based on the simple randomizer, `RandomRequestGenerator`. This generator reads an `OpenAPIObject` mapped by an OpenAPI documentation and checks all parameter types of operations existing in the `OpenAPIObject`.


Afterwards, `RandomRequestGenerator` knows which request needs which parameter type and generates random parameters for all requests and URLs appending these parameters.


### <a name="ragoParamInf"></a>Parameter Inference

Most tests based on the simple randomizing techniques are not effective because of low coverages and unusual validations. To observe more concrete test results, `InferParameter` generates tests automatically using random test results of `RandomRequestGenerator`.


Test results (responses) generated by `RandomRequestGenerator` are saved in a dictionary and utilized to infer parameters that might be usable in other requests.


If there is a same schema set in a request and a response, parameters of them are inferred by following strategies:

- Case-insensitive
- Id completion in a field name (e.g. if a property has a name "id", it gets an additional field name available in the specification)


** Notice ** : Parameter Inference is an experimental fuzzing approach inspired by the 
Specification-based Approach[^1] and RESTTESTGEN[^2]
